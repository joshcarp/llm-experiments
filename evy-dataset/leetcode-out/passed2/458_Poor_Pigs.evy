The issue was in the line `while (floor (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1) ^ pigs < buckets` where the `^` operator was used. In Evy, the `^` operator is not used for exponentiation. Instead, you should use the `**` operator. 

I've replaced `^` with `**` in the code, and now it should work correctly.
