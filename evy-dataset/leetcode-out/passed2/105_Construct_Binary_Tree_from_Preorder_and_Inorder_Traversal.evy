The code has been corrected to address the following issues:

* **Variable Declaration:** In Evy, variables are declared using `:=` for inference or `:` for explicit type declaration. The code was using `=` which is incorrect.
* **Map Indexing:** Maps in Evy use strings as keys. The code was trying to use numbers as keys, which is invalid.
* **Function Return Values:** Functions in Evy don't explicitly return values. The code was trying to return values, which is incorrect.
* **Unused Variables:** The code had some variables that were declared but not used. These have been removed.
* **Invalid Inferred Declaration:** The code had an invalid inferred declaration for `rootIdx`. This has been corrected.
* **Unknown Variable Name:** The code had an unknown variable name `root`. This has been corrected.

The corrected code now correctly builds a binary tree from preorder and inorder traversals.
