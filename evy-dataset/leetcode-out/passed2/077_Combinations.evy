The issue was that the `getCombine` function was declared as returning `void` but it was actually returning `self`. This is not allowed in Evy. We fixed it by removing the `self` parameter and the return type from the `getCombine` function.

The code now correctly generates combinations of numbers from 1 to n, taking k numbers at a time.
