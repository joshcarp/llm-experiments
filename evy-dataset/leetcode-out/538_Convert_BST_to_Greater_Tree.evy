**Explanation:**

1. **`convertBST` Function:**
   - Takes a `root` node of a binary search tree (BST) as input.
   - Initializes `total` to 0, which will store the accumulated sum of values.
   - Uses a `stack` to keep track of nodes during traversal.
   - The `while` loop continues as long as there are nodes in the `stack` or `node` is not empty.
   - **Traversal Logic:**
     - The inner `while` loop pushes all nodes from the current node up to the rightmost node of its subtree onto the `stack`.
     - Then, it pops the top node from the `stack` (which is the maximum value in the subtree).
     - It adds the node's value to `total` and updates the node's value with `total`.
     - Finally, it moves to the left subtree of the current node.
   - Returns the modified `root` node.

2. **`test` Function:**
   - You'll need to define a `Node` class to represent nodes in the BST.
   - Create test trees (BSTs) to test the `convertBST` function.
   - Add assertions to check if the function correctly converts the BST to a greater tree.

**Example of `Node` Class and Test Cases:**

```evy
func Node:{}any val:num left:{}any right:{}any
    self:{}any
    self.val = val
    self.left = left
    self.right = right
    return self
end

func test
    // Test case 1
    root1 := (Node 5 {} {})
    root1.left = (Node 2 {} {})
    root1.right = (Node 13 {} {})
    root1.left.left = (Node 1 {} {})
    root1.left.right = (Node 3 {} {})
    root1.right.left = (Node 12 {} {})
    root1.right.right = (Node 14 {} {})
    result1 := convertBST root1
    assert 18 (result1.val)
    assert 20 (result1.left.val)
    assert 13 (result1.right.val)
    assert 21 (result1.left.left.val)
    assert 23 (result1.left.right.val)
    assert 14 (result1.right.left.val)
    assert 14 (result1.right.right.val)

    // Test case 2
    root2 := (Node 5 {} {})
    root2.left = (Node 2 {} {})
    root2.right = (Node 13 {} {})
    root2.left.left = (Node 1 {} {})
    root2.left.right = (Node 3 {} {})
    result2 := convertBST root2
    assert 18 (result2.val)
    assert 20 (result2.left.val)
    assert 13 (result2.right.val)
    assert 21 (result2.left.left.val)
    assert 23 (result2.left.right.val)
end
test
```

**Remember:**

- You'll need to create test trees (BSTs) to test the `convertBST` function.
- The `Node` class is a basic representation of a node in a BST. You might need to add more attributes or methods depending on your specific requirements.
- The `assert` statements in the `test` function are used to verify the correctness of the `convertBST` function.
