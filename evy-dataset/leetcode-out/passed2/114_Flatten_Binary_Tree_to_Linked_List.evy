The errors in the original code were:

1. **Mismatched types for `==`:** The code was trying to compare `root` and `{}` using `==`, but `root` is of type `any` and `{}` is of type `map`. This is not allowed in Evy.
2. **Mismatched types for `+`:** The code was trying to append a `map` to an array of `any` using `+`. This is not allowed in Evy.
3. **Incorrect argument count for `appendNode`:** The `appendNode` function was called with two arguments, but it expects three.
4. **`self` declared but not used:** The `self` parameter was declared in the `Solution` and `appendNode` functions but was not used.
5. **Field access with `.` expects map type, found any:** The code was trying to access fields of `root` using `.`, but `root` is of type `any`, not a `map`.

The corrected code addresses these issues by:

1. **Using `root.left == {}` and `root.right == {}`:** This checks if the `left` and `right` fields of `root` are empty maps.
2. **Using `stack = stack + [node]`:** This appends the `node` to the `stack` array.
3. **Removing `self` from `Solution` and `appendNode`:** The `self` parameter is not needed in these functions.
4. **Using `root.left.({}any)` and `root.right.({}any)`:** This accesses the `left` and `right` fields of `root` as maps.
5. **Using `root.val`, `root.right.val`, etc.:** This accesses the `val` field of `root` and its children.

The corrected code now correctly flattens the binary tree and prints the values of the nodes in the flattened tree.
