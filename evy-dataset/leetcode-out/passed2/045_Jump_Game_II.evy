The code has been corrected to address the following issues:

1. **Missing return:** The `while` loop was missing a `return` statement if the loop condition was met.
2. **Unknown variable name:** The variable `nums` was not declared.
3. **Invalid inferred declaration:** The variable `maxDis` was not declared correctly.
4. **Unexpected "end":** The `end` keyword was used incorrectly in several places.
5. **Range cannot be empty:** The `for` loop had an empty range.
6. **At least one statement is required:** The `for` loop was missing a statement.
7. **Return statement not allowed:** The `return` statement was used incorrectly inside the `while` loop.
8. **Unreachable code:** Some code was unreachable due to the `return` statement.

The corrected code now correctly calculates the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of the array.
