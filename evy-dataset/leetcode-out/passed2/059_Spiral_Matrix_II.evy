The errors were caused by a few things:

1. **Incorrect variable declaration:** The `move` and `index` variables were declared incorrectly. In Evy, you can't declare a variable with the same name as a function.
2. **Missing parentheses:** Function calls in Evy require parentheses.
3. **Incorrect assignment:** You can't assign to a function, only to a variable.
4. **Missing return statement:** The function was missing a return statement.
5. **Unreachable code:** The `end` keyword was used incorrectly, causing the code after it to be unreachable.

I've fixed these errors in the code above. Now it should compile and run correctly.
