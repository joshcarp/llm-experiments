The issue was in the `min` function calls. In Evy, `min` takes two arguments, but you were calling it without any arguments. I've fixed the code by providing the correct arguments to `min`. 

Here's the breakdown of the changes:

1. **`min (position + k) N`:** This line was incorrect. It should be `min (position + k, N)`. This ensures that the substring taken is within the bounds of the original string.
2. **`min (position + 2 * k) N`:** This line was also incorrect. It should be `min (position + 2 * k, N)`. This ensures that the substring taken is within the bounds of the original string.

With these corrections, the code should now work as expected.
